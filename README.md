Currently, I am a PhD student at Northumbria University, UK with Dr Lucy Whalley. Before this, I was a research fellow at TIFR Hyderabad, India with Dr Raghunathan Ramakrishnan. I am eternally grateful for everything I have learnt through them. I am also indebted to the scientific community that help people out of thier on good will. Through Stack Overflow for I how to code by copy pasting several lines of code and playing around with keywords. I use FHI-aims everyday to perfom DFT calculations. The FHI-aims community has fantastic documentation of their code and an always ready-to-help attitude.
